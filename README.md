# Advanced Shortest Path
This is the repository for Advanced Shortest Path Project.

This is part of the Advanced Shortest Path Project by Coursera's course on Graph algorithms.

Bi-directional.cpp uses bidirectional dijkstra to process queries.

dist_with_cords.cpp uses A-star Algorithm with Eucledian distance as virtual function to process queries.

dist_preprocess_small.cpp and dist_preprocess_large.cpp use various Node Contraction Techniques for Preprocessing and Bidirectional Dijkstra for query.
